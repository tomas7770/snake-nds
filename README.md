# Snake NDS

An homebrew implementation of the classic Snake game for Nintendo DS. A follow-up to my previous [Snake GB](https://github.com/tomas7770/snake-gb), with a few new features. *Try scoring 200 points for a surprise...*

## Compatibility

Tested and known to work on [melonDS](https://melonds.kuribo64.net/) 0.9.5 **(enable DLDI in settings!)**, and a real DSi with Unlaunch + TWiLight Menu.

## Build instructions

1. Install [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started).

2. Install [NightFoxâ€™s Lib](https://github.com/knightfox75/nds_nflib).

3. Install [Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)). **The steps for this depend on your OS.**

4. Open the repository folder in a command line terminal and run `make`.
